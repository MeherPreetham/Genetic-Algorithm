# Genetic-Algorithm
This is a Genetic Algorithm designed to optimise task mapping onto multicore processors. It works on synthetic datasets generated using the random library. Metrics used to calculate the fitness are makespan, energy utilisation, and imbalance on the cores; the final fitness is a weighted sum of these three metrics.
